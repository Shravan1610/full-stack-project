# Codebase Fixes Applied - October 27, 2025

## Summary

This document outlines all the fixes and improvements applied to the ShoeHub e-commerce platform codebase based on the comprehensive code review.

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. Security Vulnerability - requireAdmin Middleware ✓

**Issue:** The `requireAdmin` function only checked for 'admin' role, not 'super_admin'

**Fix:** Updated middleware to support both roles
```typescript
// Before:
if (!profile || profile.role !== 'admin') {

// After:
if (!profile || (profile.role !== 'admin' && profile.role !== 'super_admin')) {
```

**File:** `packages/shared-lib/middleware/requireAdmin.ts`

---

### 2. React Hooks Dependencies ✓

#### useAdminAuth Hook
**Issue:** `checkAdminAccess` function was not properly memoized, causing React warnings

**Fix:** Wrapped function in `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Added `useCallback` import
- Wrapped `checkAdminAccess` in `useCallback` with `[redirectOnFail, router]` dependencies
- Updated `useEffect` to depend on `[checkAdminAccess]`

**File:** `apps/client/hooks/useAdminAuth.ts`

#### use-toast Hook
**Issue:** `state` in dependency array caused infinite re-renders

**Fix:** Removed `state` from dependency array
```typescript
// Before:
}, [state]);

// After:
}, []);
```

**File:** `packages/shared-ui/hooks/use-toast.ts`

---

### 3. Next.js Upgrade to 15.0.3 ✓

**Upgraded packages:**
- `next`: 13.5.1 → 15.0.3

### 4. Image Configuration Update ✓

**Issue:** Using deprecated `domains` configuration

**Fix:** Updated to use `remotePatterns`
```javascript
// Before:
images: {
  unoptimized: true,
  domains: ['qeqzizvpzwmfvkqhavkw.supabase.co'],
}

// After:
images: {
  unoptimized: true,
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'qeqzizvpzwmfvkqhavkw.supabase.co',
    },
  ],
}
```

**File:** `apps/client/next.config.js`

### 5. Branding Consolidation to ShoeHub ✓

**Updated all references from StyleHub to ShoeHub:**

### 6. Removed Duplicate UI Components ✓

2. Added export to `packages/shared-ui/index.ts`
3. Updated all imports from `@/components/ui/*` to `@repo/shared-ui`

### 7. TypeScript Type Improvements ✓

#### useAdminAuth Hook Types
**Before:**
```typescript
user: any | null;
profile: any | null;
```

**After:**
```typescript
import type { User } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Profile } from '@repo/database';

user: User | null;
profile: Profile | null;
```

**File:** `apps/client/hooks/useAdminAuth.ts`

#### adminClient Types
**Before:**
```typescript
let _adminSupabase: any | null = null;
export const adminSupabase: any = new Proxy({} as any, {
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Database } from './types';

let _adminSupabase: SupabaseClient<Database> | null = null;
export const adminSupabase: SupabaseClient<Database> = new Proxy({} as SupabaseClient<Database>, {
```

**File:** `packages/database/supabase/adminClient.ts`

#### API Route Error Handlers
**Changed all `err: any` to `err: unknown` with proper type guards:**
- `apps/client/app/api/admin/products/route.ts` (2 occurrences)
- `apps/client/app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts` (3 occurrences)
- `apps/client/app/api/admin/products/[id]/duplicate/route.ts` (1 occurrence)

**Also removed unnecessary `as any` type casts from Supabase queries**

---

### 8. Documentation Security Updates ✓

**Removed hard-coded Supabase project URLs from README:**
- Replaced specific project URLs with generic "your Supabase project dashboard"
- Updated environment variable examples to use placeholders
- 3 occurrences updated

**File:** `README.md`

---

### 9. Added Rate Limiting Documentation ✓

**Added new section:** "Security Best Practices"

**Content includes:**
- Recommendation for rate limiting on admin API routes
- Suggested libraries (upstash/ratelimit, express-rate-limit, @vercel/kv)
- Example implementation using Upstash Redis
- Simple in-memory rate limiting example for development

**File:** `README.md`

---

### 10. Guest Cart Improvements ✓

#### Edge Case Prevention
**Added `isMerging` state to prevent multiple simultaneous merges:**
```typescript
const [isMerging, setIsMerging] = useState(false);

const mergeGuestCart = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!user || isMerging) return; // Check if already merging
  // ...
  setIsMerging(true);
  try {
    // ... merge logic
  } finally {
    setIsMerging(false);
  }
}, [guestItems, user, isMerging]);
```

#### Loading States
**Added loading state management for guest cart operations:**
- Guest cart `addToCart` now sets loading state
- Provides visual feedback during guest cart updates

**File:** `apps/client/contexts/CartContext.tsx`

---

## 🔄 Next Steps
