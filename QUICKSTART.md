### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server
```bash
cd apps/client
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Visit Demo Pages

Open your browser and navigate to:

1. **User Demo Page**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/demo/interactive-card
   ```
   - See 6 example cards with different sneaker brands
   - Full usage instructions

### Step 3: Add to Your Pages

Choose one of these options:

#### Option A: Use the Ready-Made Component (Easiest! ‚≠ê)

In any page, add:

```tsx
import { PremiumShowcase } from "@/components/blocks/PremiumShowcase";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Your existing content */}
      
      <PremiumShowcase limit={6} theme="dark" />
      
      {/* More content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**That's it!** It will automatically fetch and display your featured products.

#### Option B: Use Individual Cards

```tsx
import { InteractiveProductCard } from "@/components/ui/card-7";

<InteractiveProductCard
  title="Nike M2K Tekno"
  description="Elevate Your Every Step"
  price="$149"
  imageUrl="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542291026-7eec264c27ff"
  logoUrl="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Logo_NIKE.svg"
/>
```

#### Option C: Replace Your Homepage

```bash
# Backup your current homepage
mv apps/client/app/page.tsx apps/client/app/page-backup.tsx

# Use the enhanced version with premium showcase
mv apps/client/app/page-enhanced.tsx apps/client/app/page.tsx
```

Now visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your new homepage!

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Best Use Cases**
   - Homepage hero sections
   - Featured product showcases
   - Landing pages
   - Admin product previews

2. **Image Requirements**
   - Use high-quality images (800x1200px minimum)
   - Portrait orientation works best
   - Ensure images are optimized (< 500KB)

3. **Performance**
   - Limit to 6-9 cards per section
   - Cards work best on desktop (mobile friendly but less interactive)
   - Use lazy loading for below-the-fold cards

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Cards not appearing?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify dev server is running
- Clear browser cache

**3D effect not working?**
- Make sure you're hovering over the card
- Check if using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Effects work best on desktop

**Images not loading?**
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Check CORS policy
- Try the example images from demo page first
